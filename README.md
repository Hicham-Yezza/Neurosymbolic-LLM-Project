# Neurosymbolic Large Language Model (LLM) Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a project that aims to combine the capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic reasoning to improve text summarization. 

## Project Structure
- **preprocessing/**: Contains scripts to preprocess data specific to each LLM.
- **evaluation/**: Contains scripts for model evaluation.
- **training_*.py**: Scripts for training specific LLMs on the summarization task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Additional libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.
